# Sorting-Algorithms
Developed Sorting Algorithms with Merge, Quick, and Insertion Sorts to determine data size and time efficiency in C++. Each algorithm utilizes the arrays of data sizes with 3 consecutive tests to determine the total amount of elapsed time for each sort. 

# Description
Each function should take an array of integers (and any other parameters chosen) and each function should sort the array using the appropriate sorting algorithm. Once the functions are written, run some tests to determine how long it takes the algorithms to sort arrays of various sizes. Called the clock() function before and after each sort to determine the total amount of elapsed time required for each sort (Gives time in milliseconds). Wrote a procedure to create dynamic arrays of various sizes filled with random values. I statically declared an array with all of the sizes (from 20000 to 640000). Tested at least 3 times with each array size and took the average of those times.
